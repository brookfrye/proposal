The NYC Law Departments General Litigation Division handles cases that challenge important City programs in diverse areas including education, health care, public assistance benefits, prison conditions, foster care, freedom of information, campaign finance and election law. Division attorneys appear in both State and federal court. Many of the division's cases are brought as class actions in federal court and raise complex and novel issues of statutory and constitutional construction. Division lawyers are responsible for their own caseloads and handle court conferences, oral arguments, discovery, the preparation of legal papers, and hearings. After the completion of orientation, attorneys hired by the Law Department will have the opportunity to elect to work from home under one of the following two programs. The first option allows attorneys to work remotely on a limited and irregular basis. The second option is a Citywide pilot program, which allows participants to select two set days to work from home each week. The two days will need to be approved by the attorneys division and take into consideration the needs of the division, as the pilot program requires more than 50% staff coverage each day. In addition, if an attorney needs to appear in court, a client meeting or other in-person work related event on a set work from home day, they will need to attend to those in-person responsibilities and will not be able to work from home that day. Participants in the pilot program must set one work from home location where they will work remotely.
